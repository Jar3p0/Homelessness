# Homelessness in America
### By Justin Richardson

In this project, I am taking a close look at the United States homelessness relief programs and how they affect homelessness levels across the United States. In my mapping, I have aggregated multiple programs that all go towards helping homeless people including:
- CoC: Continuum of Care Program
- CDBG: Community Development Block Grant Program
- Emergency Shelter Grants Program
- ESG: Emergency Solutions Grants Program
- HOME Investment Partnerships Program
- HOPWA: Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS Program
- HTF: Housing Trust Fund
- NSP: Neighborhood Stabilization Program
By analysing this data, I hope to provide insight as to where Americans are most direly affected by homelessness, and

To start, I have simply mapped homelessness in America by state.

To get rid of the population bais, I then got the percentage of the state's population that was homeless.

Looking at this map, we can see that many of the states that are suffering the most from homelessness lie on the upper east coast and along the west coast. Now lets take a look at which states have recieved the most aid towards fighting homelessness.

Comparing this map to the Homeless populations mapped earlier, we see the two are extremely similar. The maps seem to be based more on population than anything else. In order to track where we are focusing our homelessness relief efforts, we might need to track something other than just the raw amount of aid given. Lets try mapping the avaliable aid for each homeless person in each state. To improve our analysis, we will look at a larger time period.

Here we start to see where the most help for homelessness is needed in the US. While \$5,000 might seem like a lot, we must remember that this is per year, and comes out to a mere \$13.69 per day per homeless indvidual. Meanwhile, in states like Louisiana they are able to spend \$95.89 per day per homeless indvidual. Even though hundreds of millions of dollars are being poured into areas like California and Washington, they are still far less equiped to handle homelessness than their counterparts in the bible belt and mideast.
Another importat statistic to look at is whether the rate of homelessness is increasing or decreasing.

As we see with this map, the States that are needing funding the most are also some of the only states that are not seeing their homelessness decrease from 2015-2018.

In conclusion, there are several homelessness epidemics across America that are happening right now, and even the billions of dollars that are being spent on the problem are not enough to satisfy the needs of the issue. The areas that need the most help are also the areas that are recieving the most funding, but the rate simply must be increased. \$13 a day is simply not livable, and many of the issues will continue to snowball without reinforcement.
